# User Guide

This guide will help the partners in using the Compliance Took Kit portal.

Below are simple steps to use this portal:

1. The partners using the compliance tool kit should be registered partners in the system.
2. Login into CTK with the same credentials.
3. Partner can also select their preferred language while logging-in.
4. Create a project of type SBI / SDK / ABIS.
5. Create a collection by selecting the test cases that you want to test.
6. Provide the necessary details to connect to your device / SDK / ABIS service.
7. Execute the Test Run by running the collection.
8. For executing each test case, follow the instructions on the screen.
9. Once the entire collection is run, the results of the number of test cases passed or failed will be displayed.
10. You can see all the Test Run details as well. For example, the request sent to SBI, the response received from SBI, validations performed on the response and the result.
11. Test runs previously executed will be available in the Test Run history.
12. More collections can be created as per the test cases required.

Also, it highlights some of CTK's powerful features, like its pre-built test cases, validations, and detailed reporting.

![CTK Landing Page2](\_images/ctk-landing-page2.png)

The landing page provides information about the SBI, Android SBI, SDK, and ABIS specifications. Additionally, partners can download the compliance toolkit APK by selecting the download option.

![CTK Landing Page3](\_images/ctk-landing-page3.png)

## Login

Partners utilizing the compliance toolkit must be registered in the system. Once registered, partners can log in to the compliance toolkit using the same credentials they used for registration in the [Partner Management Portal](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/partner-management-services/partner-management-portal).

The partner needs to enter the registered username or e-mail and password to log in.

The partner can select the language of their preference from the dropdown in the top-right corner of the screen. Thereafter, the application is displayed in the selected language. By default, CTK supports the following languages:

* English
* French
* Arabic

_Note_: Once a partner has registered, they must go into the partner management portal to access partner details.


![CTK login page](\_images/ctk-toolkit-login.png)

## Terms and Conditions Consent

The Terms & Conditions popup window will appear for the partner after they log in. It has to be accepted by the partner. If the partner does not accept the Terms & Conditions, they will be logged out.

Also, upon logging in, partners will be prompted with a popup if there have been any changes to the Terms & Conditions since their last consent.

### Create a Collection

*   To create a collection for a project:

    * Navigate to the project details page by clicking on the project name or View option in the options list.

    ![](\_images/ctk-add-collection.png)

    * By default, application will create a `Compliance Collection` for the project, and it includes all the test cases that are based on project details.
    * `Quality Assessment Collection` will only be added by default for **SBI** projects, and it includes only quality assessment testcases.
    * Click on the `Add Collection` button and you will be redirected to the Add Collection screen.
* Enter a unique name for the collection.
* Select the test cases to be added to the collection
  * The test cases will be displayed in a tabular format with ID, Name, Description and Validator details.
  * Beside every test case, there will be a check box which needs to be selected by the partner.

![](\_images/ctk-create-collection.png)

* After selecting the test cases, the partner can click on the **Save Collection** button to save the collection.
* Once a collection is successfully created, there is a success popup shown and the partner is redirected to the Project details page.
* Once a collection is created it is displayed on the Collection Dashboard which is available on the Project details page.

![](\_images/ctk-collection-details.png)

**Few points to note**:

* A collection cannot be saved if no test cases are selected.
* A collection name cannot be empty, the partner needs to provide a unique collection name before saving the collection.
* Every collection row in the dashboard has the option to view the name of the collection, the number of test cases selected as a part of the collection, the creation date, the View Report, the Last Test Run and the Run history of the collection.

### View a Collection

Once the partner creates a collection, they can view the collection details by clicking on the collection name.

![](\_images/ctk-view-collection.png)

### Run an SBI Collection

* Before running a collection in SBI, the partner needs to connect to a device without which they cannot proceed with testing.
* The partner should click on the `Scan Device` button in the Collection Dashboard as shown below.

![](\_images/ctk-scan-device.png)

* This triggers a scan of all the configured ports in the system where the SBI is connected.
* If any device connected with an SBI is found, the application asks the partner to select an available port and the device for running the test.

![](\_images/ctk-scan-device-selection.png)

* If any device is not found, an error popup is displayed to the partner with an option to `Scan Again`.

![](\_images/ctk-scan-failed.png)

* Once the device is selected, the partner can click on the `Save` button.
* After the device is selected and saved in memory, the `Run` button for the collections is enabled.

![](\_images/ctk-run-button.png)

* If a device is already scanned and selected before running the collection, the partner can choose to re-scan and select another device for running the test case.
* If a device is selected, the partner can click on the `Run` button to run the test case.
* If the partner selects a Fingerprint Slap device but the collection is for a Double Iris device, then the test case is not executed. The partner will be shown an error message and asked to re-select the correct device. The combination validated here is for Purpose, Device Type and Sub Type as displayed below.

![](\_images/ctk-combination-validation.png)

* If the correct device is selected and the partner initiates the test run, the test case execution should start.
* During the test run,
  * A progress bar will be shown with the percentage of tests execution completed
  * A timer to show the time elapsed during the execution
  * Option to close or cancel the test run
  * Option to initiate capture for a test case or resume run after completing the operation.

![](\_images/ctk-test-run.png)

* The test run also shows,
  * The total test cases getting executed for that run
  * The current test case name
  * Instructions (if any) for the partner to follow
* Once the test execution is completed, the partner can see,
  * A high-level result with the number of test cases executed- with the number of test cases failed and the number of test cases passed in the run.

![](\_images/ctk-run-details.png)

### Run an SDK Collection

Before running the SDK collection, the partner can change the `Test Data`, the `Base URL` and the `SDK Hash` in the project settings

![](\_images/ctk-sdk-change-url-testdata.png)

* Click the `Run` button of the specific collection.
* The application now checks if the URL shared by the partner is accessible or not. If not accessible, the application shows an error message to the partner.

![](\_images/ctk-sdk-url-notaccessible.png)

* Once the run initiates with the proper URL, the execution should complete on its own and during the run, the partner can see:
  * A progress bar with the percentage of test execution completed.
  * A timer to show the time elapsed during the execution.
  * Option to close or cancel the test run.

![](\_images/ctk-sdk-run.png)

* Once the test execution is completed, the partner can see:
  * A high-level result with the number of test cases executed- with the number of test cases failed and the number of test cases passed in the run.
  * They can also see the time elapsed.
  * They also have the option to view the detailed `Test Run` report.

![](\_images/ctk-sdk-run-result.png)

_Note_: For a test run, the partner can select their data or MOSIP’s default data. But let us assume that the partner chooses their data, but in the ZIP file, they have missed adding data for a particular test case, then the system should take MOSIP’s data for the test case' execution.

![](\_images/ctk-testdata-selecting.png)

### Run an ABIS Collection

Before running the ABIS collection, the partner can change the `Username`, `Password`, `Queue names`, `Test Data`, `ABIS Hash` and the `Actice MQ URL` in the project settings
