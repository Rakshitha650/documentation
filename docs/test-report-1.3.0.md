## Test Execution Statistics

### ABIS Testing

MOSIP interfaces with an Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) to perform de-duplication of a resident's biometric data. A country may use multiple ABISs for the same biometric data and evaluate the best ABIS based on de-duplication quality. ABIS is used for 1:N de-duplication. For 1:1 authentication, Biometric SDK is used. MOSIP does not recommend using an ABIS for 1:1 authentication.

Test cases have been tested with MOSIP mock ABIS for compliance with the MOSIP specifications across 29 test cases.

| **Scenarios**     | **Mock ABIS** |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Total             | 28            |
| Passed            | 27            |
| Pending           | 0             |
| Failed            | 0             |
| NA                | 1             |
| **Test Rate (%)** | 100%          |
| **Pass Rate (%)** | 100%          |

_Out of scope_: Real ABIS testing in CTK 1.3.0

### SBI Testing

The Secure Biometric Interface (SBI) is used to interface with the biometric devices. The Compliance tool kit was tested to ensure that the interface built by the device provider is following the specifications and security rules defined in the SBI spec. The device hardware security features are not tested as a part of Compliance tool kit.
