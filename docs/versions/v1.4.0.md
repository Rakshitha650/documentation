## Overview

Version 1.4.0 of eSignet introduces a new authentication mode and addresses known issues.

1.  **Knowledge Based Authentication (KBA)**

    We are excited to share that eSignet has expanded its authentication options to include Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) as one of its factors. With eSignet's integration capabilities, existing ID repositories storing user specific details can now be easily integrated with eSignet. This integration enables OpenID based login, allowing users to access relying party services seamlessly.
