## Overview

The version 1.4.0 of eSignet focuses on launching a new authentication mode and fixes for know issues.

1. **Knowledge Based Authentication (KBA)**

   We are excited to share that eSignet has expanded its authentication options to include Knowledge-Based Authentication 
   (KBA) as one of its factors. With eSignet's integration capabilities, existing ID repositories storing user specific 
   details can now be easily integrated with eSignet. This integration enables OpenID based login, allowing users to access 
   relying party services seamlessly.
